# Competitor-sales-Analysis-In-Power-BI

## Overview: 
The core goal of this project is to build a report using a fictional Sales and Market share dataset for a manufacturing company called ***Sintec***. **Sintec is** looking for a solution to focus not only on the company's performance internally on how well their products sell but also analyze other top competitors' sales and how well they are performing against the other competitors' products.
